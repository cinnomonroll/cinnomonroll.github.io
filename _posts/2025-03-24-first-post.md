## Why I Started This Blog
Iâ€™ve always believed that the best way to truly understand something is to explain it. Recently, Iâ€™ve been attending courses, working through DataCamp, and learning a lot of new thingsâ€”some of which I donâ€™t want to forget. Thatâ€™s why I started this blog: to document what Iâ€™m learning and solidify my understanding by sharing it.

At the same time, I see this blog as a fun side project to experiment with new technologies. Building it gave me a chance to explore different tools!

Along the way, Iâ€™ll also be sharing some of my projects. Hopefully, this blog will not only help me track my progress but also be useful for others who are on a similar learning journey.

## Tech Stack & Tools I Used to Built This Blog
When I decided to create this blog, I wanted something simple, lightweight, and easy to maintain. After some research, I chose GitHub Pages for hostingâ€”it's completely free! (Though it only supports static sites.)

To generate and manage the blog, I went with Jekyll, a powerful static site generator that converts Markdown files into a fully functional website. This makes it an excellent choice for a minimal, no-database blog setup.

Hereâ€™s how I set everything up, step by step:

### Step 1: Creating a Repository
I followed the guildance from the **[official docs](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/)**. 

> Note: Always make sure you are using the latest version of the documentation. I accidentally followed an older version and encountered some issues.

- Navigate to [Chirpy-Starter](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter) and click **Use this template** button located in the top-right corner. Then select **Create New Repository**.
- Name the repository `yourusername.github.io` (replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username).
- Set the repository visibility to Public and check the box to initialize it with a README.


### Step 2: Setting Up the Environment
Instead of installing Jekyll locally, I followed the recommendation to use Docker. This approach ensures that all dependencies are managed within a container, reducing setup errors. If you prefer exploring other Jekyll themes, consider browsing options at **[Jamstack Themes](https://jamstackthemes.dev/ssg/jekyll/)**

- Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
  - For MacOS users: Launch Docker and ensure you see the Docker icon in the top-right corner of your screen, which indicates that Docker is active.
- Clone your repository within a container by following the instructions provided in[VS Code's docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_quick-start-open-a-git-repository-or-github-pr-in-an-isolated-container-volume)

If you encounter difficulties with the container setup, here's an alternative method that worked for me:

1. **Clone the repository** manually and navigate to the project directory.
2. Launch the Command Palette by pressing`Cmd + Shift + P`.
3. **Type and select** `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.
4. VS Code will: 
  - Detect your .devcontainer folder
  - Build the container
  - Open the project inside the container
5. After a few minutes, your terminal should display something similar to:
  ```
  `vscode âžœ /workspaces/ourusername.github.io (main)`
  ```

### Step 3:Start the Jekyll Server
To run the site locally, use the following command:
```
bundle exec jekyll s
```
After a few seconds, the local server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:4000`

### Step 4:Writing and Customizing the Blog
Once the blog was running, I started customizing it to make it my own. Here are some key customizations I made:

âœ” **Updating Blog Info in `_config.yml`**

The **`_config.yml`** file contains the blogâ€™s main settings. I updated it with my own information by following the provided guidelines. For any settings I didnâ€™t need, I simply left them blank.

> Note: After making changes to **`_config.yml`** you need to restart the local server for it to take effect:
> ```
> bundle exec jekyll s
> ```

âœ” **Uploading an Avatar**

I found a cute avatar from **[Avatar Generator](https://www.peppercarrot.com/extras/html/2020_mobilizon-generator/)**. and decided to use it for my profile. Since this was an online source, I didnâ€™t create it myselfâ€”I just referred to it as my avatar.

Once I had the image, I stored it in the **`assets/`** folder, where all images for the blog are kept.

âœ” **Modifying the Sidebar (`_tabs/`Directory**)

The sidebar includes sections such as **`about.md`**, **`archives.md`**, **`tags.md`** and **`categories.md`**. You can customize their order by modifying their files.

For my setup, I only updated **`about.md`** and left the other sections as default.

âœ” **Creating a New Blog Post**

All blog posts are stored in the **`_posts/`** directory.
Each post file name follows this format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ArticleName.md`
> Note: The date in the filename cannot be in the future.

Each post follows this format:
```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Name"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
categories: [blog]
tags: [jekyll, customization]
---

This is my first blog post! ðŸš€
```

### Step 5: Deploy Using Github Actions
To configure the GitHub Pages service, follow these steps:
- Go to your repository and select **Settings**
- Click on **Pages** in the left navigation bar 
- In the **Source** section, select **`GitHub Actions`** from the dropdown menu.
- Push any commits to GitHub to trigger the Actions workflow. 

Once the build is complete and successful, the site will be deployed automatically!

#### Troubleshooting Git Remote URL Issues

I encountered an issue where Git automatically rewrote URLs starting with `https://github.com/` to `git@github.com:`. EvenEven forcing HTTPS didn't work. To resolve this:

1. Check the Global "insteadOf" Rule:
```
git config --global --get-regexp "url.*insteadOf"
```
This command outputs a rule indicating that Git is rewriting `https://github.com/` to `git@github.com:`

2. Remove the Rule:
```
git config --global --unset-all url.git@github.com:.insteadof
```
3. Verify the Remote URL:
```
git remote get-url origin
```

You should see:
```
https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git
```

You're all set!

#### 3. Installing Dependencies
Since Chirpy is built with Jekyll, I first needed to install Ruby and necessary Jekyllâ€™s dependencies:

For macOS (using Homebrew):
```sh
brew install ruby
gem install bundler jekyll
```
Then, inside the project folder, I installed the necessary gems:
```
bundle install
```

The `bundle` command automatically installs all dependencies specified by `Gemfile`.
