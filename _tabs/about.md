Hi, Iâ€™m Ting! I live in Ontario, Canada, and I love learning about AI, backend development, and cloud computing.

I enjoy solving problems, building things, and figuring out how technology works. When Iâ€™m not coding, you might find me baking (Swedish cinnamon rolls are my favorite!).

This blog is where I share what Iâ€™m learning, cool projects Iâ€™m working on, and maybe a few random thoughts along the way.

ðŸŒ± Always curious, always learning.
